The extended Ngaro VM is a very low-level but platform independent vm, 
written in C. It evolved from Ngaro (see retro forth) and is binary
compatible with it.

It is uncommon mainly in tree aspects:

* New instructions can be generated at runtime (which extend the instruction
  set) from vm-code sequences.

* The encoding ensures high performance though a platform independent
  native-code compiler and support for stack, register and matrix operations.

* It's a accumulator/store design with efficient interpretation in mind.
