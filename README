Baíran is a very low-level but platform independent vm, written in C.
It is uncommon mainly in tree aspects:

* New instructions can be generated at runtime (which extend the instruction
  set without special encoding) from vm-code sequences.

* The encoding ensures high performance though instruction bundling and 
  support for fine-grained parallel execution.

* It's a accumulator/store design with efficient interpretation in mind.
